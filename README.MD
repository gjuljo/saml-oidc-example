# SAML AND OIDC AUTHENTICATION PROTOTYPE

## INTRODUCTION
The aim of this prototype is to show how both SAML and OIDC authentication mechanisms can coexist in the same solution, whether SAML is used to authenticate the access to a web application (i.e. gosaml) while OIDC is used to authenticate an API call to another application (i.e. goapi).
Both authentication mechanisms are implemented using [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), but this solution includes more components such as [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) for path-based routing, [Keycloak Gatekeeper](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-gatekeeper) as OIDC reverse-proxy and [Kong](https://konghq.com/) as API Gateway.
To better explain the role that each component plains in this example solution, we'll adopt a step-by-step approach, by introducing each element one by one.  

## DEPENDENCIES
This example is based on a single Docker Compose file that includes all the services involved at each stage of the implementation. 
Use `git checkout` to switch from one stage to another, accordingly to each corresponding tag.

### **DISCLAIMER**
**Please be aware that this solution is implemented for test and education purposes only and it should not be uses ad-is in production environments. In particular, to simplify the setup, secrets and passwords are stored in the configuration files, without any specific protections that are a 'must-have' requirement for production environments.**


## STARTUP
As Keycloak takes a while to startup, it's better to start it before the other containers and wait till it's up and running:

```console
docker-compose up -d test-oidc
```

Ensure that Keycloak is up and running by looking its logs:

```console
docker-compose logs -f test-oidc
```

You should see something like the following:

```
oidc | 08:29:17,535 INFO  [org.jboss.as] (Controller Boot Thread) WFLYSRV0060: Http management interface listening on http://127.0.0.1:9990/management
oidc | 08:29:17,535 INFO  [org.jboss.as] (Controller Boot Thread) WFLYSRV0051: Admin console listening on http://127.0.0.1:9990
oidc | 08:29:17,536 INFO  [org.jboss.as] (Controller Boot Thread) WFLYSRV0025: Keycloak 7.0.0 (WildFly Core 9.0.2.Final) started in 42509ms - Started 682 of 987 services (701 services are lazy, passive or on-demand)
```

You can also open the Keycloak Admin console at the link [http://localhost:8080/auth/](http://localhost:8080/auth/)

## USERS AND PASSWORDS
The following users are defined in the Keycloak server:
- admin/password
- pippo/pippopippo
- paperino/paperinopaperino


## 1-SAMLONLY
Start the SAML application (gosaml).

```
docker-compose up -d test-gosaml
```

Once the application is started, open the browser at the link [http://gosaml.lvh.me:8000/](http://gosaml.lvh.me:8000/). You'll be redirected to the Keycloak login page as the application requires a SAML-based authentication.
Provide username and password (pippo/pippopippo) to login and the browser should open a simple web page where you can enter some text. When you press the **OK** button, the web application sends the text to the server that, in this implementation, will just reply with the text *this is the default implementation*.
In further stages of this solution, this back-end API will be replaced with a different implementation that will revert the word order of the text provided in the input field. The Nginx component will route the API call to this second implementation.

## 2-OIDC
In this second stage we introduce Keycloak Gatekeeper as security proxy, to inforce the OIDC authentication before calling the SAML application. Behind the scene a double authentication in in place, involving a single sign-on scenario, even if the user won't notice it as only one login is requested.

Stop the further solution, if needed, then start this new one once test-oidc is running again:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

The following sequence diagram shows the interation between the three involved components:
